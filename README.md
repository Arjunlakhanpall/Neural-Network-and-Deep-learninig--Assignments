# Neural Networks and Deep Learning – Assignments

This repository contains the assignments from the **"Neural Networks and Deep Learning"** course offered by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning), taught by **Andrew Ng**.

## 📚 Course Overview

This course is part of the Deep Learning Specialization and introduces foundational concepts and tools to build and train deep neural networks. Key topics include:

- Binary classification using logistic regression as a neural network
- Vectorization and broadcasting
- Activation functions (sigmoid, tanh, ReLU)
- Forward and backward propagation
- Cost function and gradient descent
- Building shallow and deep neural networks from scratch using Python and NumPy

## 📝 Assignments Included

1. **Week 2**: Python Basics with NumPy – Implement basic functions needed for deep learning.
2. **Week 3**: Shallow Neural Networks – Forward and backward propagation for a 2-layer neural network.
3. **Week 4**: Deep Neural Networks – Build and train an L-layer deep neural network.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebooks

## 💡 Note

These assignments are part of the coursework and are meant for educational purposes. All implementations are done from scratch without using deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
